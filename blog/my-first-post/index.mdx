* From the Tuscan Hills to Emmanuel Road. Two girls share their diaries.

Hallo! I am Maya, and live in Tuscany, in Italy, in the mountains
near a small village.
These days at home have been relaxing but also boring without
my friends. I’m sad I can’t see them and am looking forward to
playing with them again and going on my uni cycle.
The worst thing is, that my mum is stuck in London and can’t fly
back until...? I can’t wait to see her again!
I do virtual lessons now with my teachers and the other three
kids in my class (my school is very small!) This is funny, because
the picture and the sound on the PC keeps breaking up, and it
sometimes sounds like they say some silly things.
Life is not so different here now, than normal. l’m lucky to be
in the middle of nowhere in a house on it’s own, because I can
always go outside to play, or help my dad with the gardening.
When it rains I’m usually on the PC or play cards with my dad.
I hope you are not getting too bored and finding things to make
you happy.
Stay strong, we can do it!
And soon everyone can be together again.

My life had changed quicker than I had thought possible.
I thought it would be fine, I thought I would want it to last, but I
want it to end. NOW! I can’t take it anymore.
I can practically feel the pressure pushing down on
me. The stress spreading into every single inch of my body. The
laughter and joy seeping out of me. I keep telling myself it will be
okay, not to worry, but it feels as if a bucket of cold water is being
poured over my little flame of hope. And I know eventually that
flame will stop re-lighting itself. I don’t know how much longer I
can keep it up.
The schoolwork feels so much harder now I don’t have my
friends to talk about it with. I’m staying up hours past my bedtime
trying to finish it off. Because I’m not coming home any more I feel
like I just can’t leave it behind. I know I shouldn’t be spreading all
MY troubles and worries to you, I know I should be telling you not
to worry, that it will all be fine, but, I hate to break it to you but
we are NOT living in a story book.
Who knows how long this will last, who knows what we’ll lose,
who knows what might happen. This may be our last stand, the
time we fall, life will never be the same. We are living through
history. The world is bending and shaping right in front of us. We
may close our eyes and never open them again. But we have to
be brave. To stand together as one, be united, to straighten up
again after we stumble and to stand up after we fall. Why don’t
you write down all the stress and troubles you’ve been feeling
and thinking, write about what has been happening to you. Maybe
once this ends you can burn what you have written, burn away all the things building up inside you, or you can bury what you have
written, for the future to find.
