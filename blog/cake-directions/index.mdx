* Kiki Ulph, and her family, live on Emmanuel Road. Here she writes of her
lockdown experience & gives us her recipe for Marble Bunt Cake

Ingredients

225g caster sugar, 275g self-raising flour, 2 level tsp baking
powder, 4 large eggs, 2 tbs milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 2 tbs
cocoa powder, 2 tbs hot water, 50g icing sugar

Directions

Heat oven 160 C. Grease cake tin/bunt mould. Beat butter
and sugar until pale. Add flour, baking powder, eggs, milk
and vanilla extract. Beat for 2 minutes until well blended. In
another bowl mix cocoa with hot water then add half of the
vanilla mixture and combine. Spoon vanilla mixture into the
tin/bunt mould first, then add cocoa mixture on top. Use a
butter knife and swirl cocoa into vanilla mixture for the marble
effect. Bake in the oven for 1 hour, take out onto wire rack to
cool and sprinkle with icing sugar.
