Welcome to the
*Hyde Farm* community newspaper!
A huge **Thank you** to everyone who has
sent messages, articles and support, and in
particular to those who have been so generous
in donating to the justgiving page, whuch has
enabled this second issue to be published.
Inside this issue you’ll find articles on the
social history of The Hyde Farm Estate, with
recollections from a number of our residents.
There’s a look at The Woodfield Pavilion
which reopened last year, and two girls have
generously written on how this lockdown is
affecting their lives. Alongside this there’s a
feature on the WW2 bomb incident at Balham
Underground Station and a guide to the flora
and fauna on Tooting Common.
Quentin Blake has put online a series
of e-cards that you can send to friends and
family (see inside) and you can
find these visa his website
www.quentinblake.com
Whether there will be a third issue is very

much up to you. The costs of this issue have been
raised by the justgiving page, to cover the costs of
printing 700 copies. We now need a further £300
to print a third edition.
Common People is FREE, to enable everyone to
have a copy, and there’ll be pick-up points at the
Hyde Farm Cafe & Shop and Cosy Corner.
If you would like to donate to the costs, even
£1, then that would be wonderful. There will be
a donation box inside the Hyde Farm Cafe, but a
‘just giving’ page which you can find at:
https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/
hydefarmnewspaper
may be simpler. Any surplus donations will be
given to our local food bank via St Thomas’.
There are more articles in the pipeline, but
PLEASE do contribute news, gardening tips ...
and email by the 30th of May to ...
