        <h3>Brief introduction to Hyde Farm Conservation Area</h3>
        <div>
          Introduction The Hyde Farm Conservation Area is located on the western
          edge of Lambeth at the borough boundary with the London Borough of
          Wandsworth; immediately north of Tooting Bec Common. The conservation
          area was designated following a campaign by local residents in
          February 1996; and the boundary was redrawn following another campaign
          in October 2015. The designation covers part of the Hyde Farm Estate,
          which was developed from the late 1890â€™s and completed in 1916; a good
          quality housing estate constructed solely for rent, along with some
          associated community buildings. Its architectural interest derives
          from the property types (mostly Tyneside flats), the high quality of
          construction and refinement and unity of architectural details. Design
          coherence on the residential properties is achieved through common
          property types, the use of a consistent palette of robust materials
          and repetitive architectural detailing which is both well designed and
          of good quality. Its historic interest derives from its primary
          construction by Edward Hayes Dashwood who set aside some properties
          for veterans of the Boer War and First World War and later the
          Dashwood Foundation which he set up to provide homes for ex-service
          people. Only the most noteworthy parts of the estate have been
          included within the Conservation Area; the boundary being tightly
          drawn to primarily include the Tyneside Flats.
